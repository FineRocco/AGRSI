## Project

This project consists of the risk assessment and an initial incident response plan for PowerPlus,
the study scenario presented in class. The result to be delivered is a report addressed to the
Information Security and IT Risk Management. The document must have a maximum of 30 pages
(excluding cover and table of contents). All attachments supporting the results presented, e.g.,
spreadsheet(s) must be submitted. The project should be carried out in groups of three to four
elements.
The report should contain the following chapters (or others with similar content): Introduction,
Establishing the Context, Risk Assessment, Incident Scenarios, SOC Preparation, Conclusions, and
References. Additional chapters and annexes, e.g. Treatment Proposal, may be included. The
chapter "Risk Assessment" shall present the results of the various stages of risk assessment
according to ISO/IEC 27005:2022 (ISO/IEC, 2022). The eight most important types of risk should
be identified. If deemed appropriate, concrete controls may be proposed for each identified risk.
In the chapter "Incident Scenarios", three attack scenarios should be conceptualised. The " SOC
Preparation" chapter should describe the aspects to be monitored by PowerPlus's SOC and
describe in detail three incident response cases.
As we do not have access to all data on PowerPlus, the assessment of risks and conception of
incident scenarios should consider the information provided and the options revealed to be
appropriate, which should be justified.
References should be used to support the methodology and options. In particular, the concepts
and processes in ISO/IEC 27005:2022 (ISO/IEC, 2022), ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (ISO/IEC, 2022), and
ISO 31000:2018 (ISO/IEC, 2018) should be adopted. It is possible to integrate other
guidelines/methodologies, such as the one described by Ross et al. (2012). References should
follow the APA style (APA, 2016). The cover of the paper must contain the name and student
number of all authors.
